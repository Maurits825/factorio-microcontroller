# Factorio-CPU
This project contains scripts and docs for a microcontroller made in the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/).
## To Do's
 - instruction is 24bits right now, 8 bit opcode 16 bit literal
this could be 32 bits 8bit opcode, 24 bit literal, just change the roll and masking numbers
- clock speed testing
- upgrade 40 signal memory to more? 100 maybe
- python script for rom
- add more instructions: call/return, halt, reset, more branching
